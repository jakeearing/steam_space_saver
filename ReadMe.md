# Steam Space Saver

## Description
Steam Space Saver is a command-line tool designed to help you reclaim valuable storage space on your computer by optimizing game installations on the Steam platform. The tool focuses on removing unnecessary files, such as language files for non-English languages, unused multiplayer modes, and large story mode cutscenes.

## Features
- **Language Files Optimization:** Removes non-essential language files for non-English languages, freeing up space occupied by redundant content.
- **Unused Multiplayer Modes:** Identifies and removes files associated with dead multiplayer modes or other modes/functions that are rarely utilized. Example: Removes the Doom 2016 multiplayer maps as well as anything related to SnapMap.
- **Story Mode Cutscene Management:** For removing extremely large story mode cutscenes for certain games such as Mortal Kombat 11, Injustice 2, and Tekken 7, etc. This is particularly beneficial if you don't plan on playing the story mode or have already completed it.
- **Dynamic Updates:** The tool is a work in progress, and more games will be added upon request. Stay tuned for regular updates and improvements.
